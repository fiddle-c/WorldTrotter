# WorldTrotter
WorldTrotter is a project from the textbook "iOS Programming: The Big Nerd RanchGuide" by Christian Keur and Aaron Hillegass. 


The WorldTrotter project covered views and view hierarchy, auto layout, view controllers, programmatic implementations, text input, delegations, localization, and internalization.

The WorldTrotter application introduces the user with a Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion calculator.
